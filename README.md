### Editor with Plugin

- VSCode with Rust-Analyzer Plugin
- RustRover by JetBrains
- Neovim with rust-analyzer lsp

## Preparation

Clone this repository and compile and run the project. Doing this in advance saves us time. Compilation can take some time, but incremental builds run fast!

cd bevy
cargo run
```

Designing a game is hard. Building a game is hard. Rust is hard. Bevy has a learning curve. In short, expect to get stuck and have a drink while finding your way.
